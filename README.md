# iso-manifest

Target input is a directory containing IROMLAB project subdirectories. 
* Will pull assigned disc names from individual rip directories and original disc names from ISOs - workflow calls for updating directory names and leaving ISO names as-is.
* If a metadata directory exists, manifest will be output there. If no metadata directory, manifest will be created in the target directory.
